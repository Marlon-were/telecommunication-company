### AN ANALYSIS OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY

## Business Understanding

The telecommunications industry is inundated with companies that offer electronic communication services that enable the transfer of data like text, speech, audio, or video over the world. They can be classified as wireless carriers, mobile network operators, and satellite providers.

# Business Objectives

1. Determine the number of subscribers that discontinue the services offered by a telecom service provider (Churn rate).

2. Measure the profitability at customer level to determine the average revenue per user(ARPU).

3. Establish the cost of acquiring or upgrading physical assets that support its communication services.

4. Implement strategies that can help grow its customer base or that can lead to an increase in subscription numbers.

# Key Hypothesis

1. Having dependents can be expensive, so members terminate their subscriptions to save money.

2. Users may abandon the company if they do not have access to fast internet service.

3. Difficult payment procedures prevent clients from paying or renewing their subscriptions.

4. Lack of sufficient security mechanisms on various platforms exposes customers to a variety of threats, including fraud, forcing them to leave.

5. Subscribers with higher usage levels are less likely to discontinue services compared to those with lower usage levels.

6. Improving customer response tines will decrease the churn rate.

7. Offering targeted loyalty rewards will reduce churn among long-term customers.

8. Introducing premium service packages will increase the average revenue per user.

9. Customers using bundled services will exhibit a higher ARPU compared to single-service users.
